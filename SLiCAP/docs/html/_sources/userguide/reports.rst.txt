There are multiple ways of creating or updating reports with SLiCAP:

#. Use the functions from the `SLiCAPhtml <../reference/SLiCAPhtml.html>`__ module to create a web site with text, tables, typesetted equations, and figures. 
#. Write your report in LaTeX and use functions from the `SLiCAPlatex <../reference/SLiCAPlatex.html>`__ module to update your report with design data.
#. Write your report in Sphinx and use functions from the `SLiCAPrst <../reference/SLiCAPrst.html>`__ module to update your report with design data.
